a)Block scope:
-let use garera variable define garda, that is block/function level scope.Matlab let use garyo bhane,
,tyo,duita curly braces bhitra(eg. loops,simple block{}) matra defined ho, 
tyo bhanda bahira not defined.

b)function scope:
-let use garera variable define garda, that is block/function level scope.Matlab let use garyo bhane,
,function bhitra matra ta variable is defined, bahira it's not defined.

-NOTE:SO BASICALLY, Block ra function scope is let use garyo bhane, block ma let use gareko
cha bhane that's block scope, function ma let use gareko cha bhane that's function scope.

2.GLOBAL scope
-var is global scope, var use garera define gareko kura globally defined.
-kei na lekhi define gare ni, that's global scope
