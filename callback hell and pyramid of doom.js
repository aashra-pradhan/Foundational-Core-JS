//callbacks have drawbacks and shouldn't be used at all times during asynchronous programming
//callback hell
//pyramid of doom - callbacks bhitra callbacks use garda, the code horizontally grow hudai
//jancha towards the right(on encountering every asynchronous action), and becomes a
// pyramid of doom.
//This is not easy readability of code and not good a practise. Esko solution is using promises.

//If you waant to use 1-2 callbacks, you can use callbacks but if calback bhitra callback tannai
//then use alternatives like promises and async. await.
